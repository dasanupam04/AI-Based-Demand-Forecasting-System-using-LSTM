PROJECT STAGE:
Data Ingestion Layer

---------------------------------------------------------
🎯 PURPOSE OF THIS FILE
---------------------------------------------------------
This file is the starting point of the entire AI-Based 
Demand Forecasting System.

Its purpose is to load the raw dataset into memory and 
validate its structure before any analysis or modeling 
is performed.

Every data-driven system must begin by ensuring the data 
exists, is readable, and has the expected structure.

Without correct data ingestion, the entire pipeline fails.

---------------------------------------------------------
🧠 WHAT PROBLEM THIS FILE SOLVES
---------------------------------------------------------
Before building forecasting models or analytics systems,
we must answer:

• Is the dataset accessible?
• Are column names correct?
• Is the dataset large enough?
• Are there obvious structural issues?

This file confirms that the raw retail dataset is usable
for downstream modeling and intelligence layers.

---------------------------------------------------------
⚙️ WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE THIS FILE
---------------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ The CSV file (retail_store_inventory.csv) is loaded 
   using pandas.

2️⃣ The dataset shape is printed.
   This tells us:
   - Number of rows (observations)
   - Number of columns (features)

3️⃣ Column names are displayed.
   This ensures:
   - Expected fields exist
   - No spelling inconsistencies

4️⃣ The first few rows are previewed.
   This allows manual inspection of:
   - Data format
   - Value types
   - Potential anomalies

---------------------------------------------------------
📊 WHY THIS STEP IS IMPORTANT
---------------------------------------------------------
This step builds confidence that:

• The dataset path is correct
• The file is not corrupted
• The schema matches expectations
• The project can proceed safely

It prevents debugging chaos later.

In professional systems, this is called:
"Data Validation & Schema Verification"

---------------------------------------------------------
🔗 HOW IT CONNECTS TO THE PROJECT
---------------------------------------------------------
This file feeds directly into:

→ 02_eda.py (Exploratory Data Analysis)
→ 03_preprocessing.py
→ Baseline & LSTM models
→ All analytical modules

If this step fails, every subsequent step fails.

This is the foundation of the entire architecture.

🏗 ARCHITECTURAL POSITION
---------------------------------------------------------
Layer 1: Raw Data Layer
Layer 2: Validation Layer   ← This file
Layer 3: Feature Engineering
Layer 4: Modeling
Layer 5: Intelligence & Decisions
Layer 6: Dashboard Deployment


---------------------------------------------------------

"In the first stage of the project, I implemented a data
ingestion and validation layer to ensure that the retail
dataset was structurally sound before performing any 
forecasting or modeling tasks. This helped establish a 
clean foundation for the entire pipeline."

---------------------------------------------------------
🧠 KEY LEARNING
---------------------------------------------------------
Strong AI systems do not begin with models.
They begin with verified data.

Data reliability > Model complexity.
